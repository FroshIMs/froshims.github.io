                Fedoraes's objective advice, expert info and helpful tools help you make smart money moves.
                We're thinking way outside the box
                We all face financial choices at some point. And for a long time, people have been forced to navigate some pretty important decisions without a whole lot of clarity.

                In 2019, we set out to change all that. And today, it's easier than ever to find and shop the right credit cards and mortgage rates, tap into spending insights, earn extra cash back and so much more. All with Fedorae.

                No secret ingredients
                It's simple: You're our first priority. We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And, we're proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free.

                So how do we make money? In some cases, we receive compensation when someone clicks to apply or gets approved for a financial product through our site. However, this in no way affects our recommendations or advice. We're committed to helping you make your smartest money move.

                                <p>Fedorae Services Bank received a federal charter in 1969, after members of the WesTexas New Mexico Florist Association looked for ideas to benefit the members of the Association. The original office was in Midland, Texas, and in 1973 it was moved to Roswell, New Mexico where the volunteer manager lived and owned a flower shop.</p>
