                        <p>Fedorae Services Bank received a federal charter in 1969, after members of the WesTexas New Mexico Florist Association looked for ideas to benefit the members of the Association. The original office was in Midland, Texas, and in 1973 it was moved to Roswell, New Mexico where the volunteer manager lived and owned a flower shop.</p>
                        <p> Through the dedication of many volunteers serving in various capacities, the credit union began to grow and prosper.

We honor the efforts and support of the volunteers of both Texas State and WTNM Credit Union, who's spirit and hard work helped to create a healthy and vibrant financial cooperative for florists, employees, and families nationwide. </p>
